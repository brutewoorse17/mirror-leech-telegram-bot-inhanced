## üõ† How to Use New Features

### Performance Monitoring
```python
from bot.helper.ext_utils.performance_monitor import monitor_performance, start_performance_monitoring

# Decorate functions to monitor
@monitor_performance()
async def my_function():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Start monitoring (add to startup)
await start_performance_monitoring()
```

### Optimized File Operations
```python
from bot.helper.ext_utils.optimized_file_ops import OptimizedFileOps

# Copy files with optimal buffering
await OptimizedFileOps.copy_file_optimized(src, dst)

# Batch operations
operations = [
    OptimizedFileOps.copy_file_optimized(src1, dst1),
    OptimizedFileOps.copy_file_optimized(src2, dst2),
]
results = await OptimizedFileOps.batch_file_operations(operations)
```

### Error Handling
```python
from bot.helper.ext_utils.error_handler import retry_async, CircuitBreaker, RetryConfig

# Retry with custom configuration
@retry_async(RetryConfig(max_attempts=5, base_delay=2.0))
async def unreliable_function():
    # Your code here
    pass

# Circuit breaker for external services
@CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=30)
async def external_api_call():
    # Your code here
    pass
```

## üîß Configuration Recommendations

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable performance optimizations
PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Memory management
